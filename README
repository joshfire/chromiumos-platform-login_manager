The login manager coordinates with X to gather username/password.

We currently use the "slim" login manager (see http://slim.berlios.de/),
so if/until we write out own, this directory actually contains a chromeos
theme for slim. Slim is a lightweight login manager that helps with login
and X startup.

We also add a configuration file for slim to make it use the pam module
we wrote to authenticate against Google Accounts
